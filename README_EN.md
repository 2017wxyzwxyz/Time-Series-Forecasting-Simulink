# Recursive Forecasting using Arbitrary Time Series Model on Simulink®

Let's run time series forecasting on the Simulink!!​

## Introduction

This page introduces how to implement time series models concretely for the following requirements.

- Build in Deep Learning capabilities on a developing Simulink model​
- Try various time series models on the Simulink​
- Implement features supported by MATLAB Product family on a Simulink model​

Each folder has MATLAB codes and Simulink model, and their names correspond to time series models or layers of neural network respectively.

## Key Takeaways 

This page focuses on the 2 products.​

* Deep Learning Toolbox™​
* Econometrics Toolbox™​

They offer features to forecast time series recursively and each example describes how to implement their features on the Simulink and to invoke them via the MATLAB Function block. This technique does not apply only to the above products but can be adopted additional features for time series analysis in particular regression, which are provided by other products such as 

- Predictive Maintenance Toolbox™​
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox™​
- System Identification Toolbox™​


## Requirements

* MATLAB R2020a
* Simulink
* Deep Learning Toolbox  (requireed by GRU/LSTM)
* Econometrics Toolbox  (requireed by ARIMAX/SSM)
